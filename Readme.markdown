# Markdownr.com

[Markdownr.com][] is a simple website for previewing [markdown][] on the fly. [Markdownr.com][] uses the [RDiscount](http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount) library to parse [markdown][] input. All parsing is done inside of a Rails 3 metal controller, so it is very fast. Some styles were inspired by [GitHub](http://github.com).

[Markdownr.com][] now supports [Textile](http://redcloth.org/) and [RDoc](http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/). I'm currently working on improving support for these and other languages.

Feel free to visit [Markdownr.com][] or to fork and improve.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com) for all of explanations, answers to my dumb questions, and simply being awesome. Thanks to everyone who has opened issues or emailed me ideas for improvement.
