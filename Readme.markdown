# Markdownr.com

[Markdownr.com][] is a simple website for previewing [markdown][] on the fly. [Markdownr.com][] uses the [RDiscount](http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount) library to parse [markdown][] input. All parsing is done inside of a Rails 3 [generic action](http://yehudakatz.com/2009/12/20/generic-actions-in-rails-3), so it is very fast. Styles inspired by [GitHub](http://github.com).

Feel free to visit [Markdownr.com][] or fork and improve.
